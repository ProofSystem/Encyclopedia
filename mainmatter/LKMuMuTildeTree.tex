% The following sections ("clarifications", "history",
% "technicalities") are optional. If you use them,
% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences.
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks
% do not look nice in a short entry.
\begin{clarifications}
There are three kinds of nodes, $\vdash A$ for asserting formulas, $A
\vdash$ for refuting formulas, and $\vdash$ for expressing a
contradiction. Annotation by proof-terms can optionally be added as in
\iref{LKMuMuTilde}. Negation $\neg A$ can be defined as $A \rightarrow \bot$.
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
The purpose of this system is to show that the original distinction in
Gentzen~\cite{Gentzen1935} between natural deduction presented as a
tree of formulas and sequent calculus presented as a tree of sequents
is no longer relevant. It is known from at least
Howard~\cite{Howard80} that natural deduction can be presented with
sequents. The above formulation shows that systems based on left and
right introductions (``sequent-calculus style'') can be presented as a
sequent-free tree of formulas~\cite{HerbelinHdR}.

The terminology ``sequent calculus'' seems to have become popular
from~\cite{Prawitz65} followed then e.g. by~\cite{Troelstra73} who
were associating the term ``sequents'' to Gentzen's LJ and LK systems.
%In works prior to Prawitz, wording such as Gentzen-type calculi can be
%found~\cite{Kleene52}.
The terminology having lost the connection to its
etymology, this motivated some authors to use alternative
terminologies such as ``L'' systems~\cite{Munch-Maccagnoni09}.
\end{history}

% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to
% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
% \end{history}
%\begin{technicalities}
%The system is obviously logically equivalent to Gentzen's LK when
%equipped with the appropriate connectives.

% General Instructions:
% =====================
% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page.
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
% * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
% (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
% * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry,
% consider splitting your entry.
%
% * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
% that are already described in other entries.
%
% * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
%
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page,
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.
% Citation Instructions:
% ======================
% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.
% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.
% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing"
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry,
% as explained within the "history" environment above.
% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself.
% This is done automatically.
% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
