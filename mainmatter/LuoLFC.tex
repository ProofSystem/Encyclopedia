	\begin{clarifications}
We follow~\cite{LuoSolXue:13}. In this entry the extensions $T[C]$ of the logical framework $\LuoLF$\iref{}
are considered. Here $T$ is a type theory specified in $\LuoLF$ (formally, an extension
of $\LuoLF$) and
 $C$ is a (possibly infinite)
set of subtyping judgements of the form $\Gamma\seq A<_cB:Type$. 
The set $C$ itself
may be generated by some user-defined rules. As coercive definition rule
above shows, coercive subtyping is considered as an 
{\em abbreviation mechanism}, the expressions without coercions are 
considered as ``abbreviations'' of the expressions where coercions are 
inserted. For corcive subtyping as an abbreviation mechanism, one of central
questions is the concervativity of the extension $T[C]$ over $T$.

The system $T[C]$ is built by ``layers''
and in this sense may be considered as {\em hybrid}. Above the rules
(except structural rules) of the {\em subkinding} level are given. 
The structure (and rules)
of the subtyping level, as well as its connection with the 
subkinding level, are explained below. 

First the intermediate system $T[C]_0$ is defined. 
The syntax of $T[C]_0$ is the same
as the syntax of $T$ ({\em i.e.}, type theory specified in $\LuoLF$). The rule
 $$\infer{\Gamma\seq A<_cB:Type}{\Gamma\seq A<_cB:Type\in C}$$ is added, 
and the structural subtyping rules
given below.  They state that the subtyping relation $<$ (annotated
by coercion terms $c$) is congruent, transitive, and closed under
substitution, and satisfies the rules of weakening and contextual equality.

{\bf Remark.} Similar structural rules are included in the subkinding level 
above.

Structural rules
$$
\infer{\Gamma\seq A'<_{c'}B'}{\Gamma\seq A<_cB\!\quad\!\Gamma\seq A=A':Type
\!\quad\!\Gamma\seq B=B'\!\quad\!\Gamma\seq c=c':(El(A))El(B)}
$$
$$\infer{\Gamma\seq A_{c'\circ c}A''}{\Gamma\seq A<_cA'\!\quad\!\Gamma\seq A'<_{c'}A''}$$
$$\infer{\Gamma, [k/x]\Gamma'\seq [k/x]A<_{[k/x]c}[k/x]B}{\Gamma, x:K, \Gamma'\seq A<_c B
\!\quad\!\Gamma\seq k:K}\,\,\,\,\,\infer{\Gamma, \Gamma'',\Gamma'\seq A<_cB}{\Gamma, \Gamma'\seq A<_cB\!\quad\!\Gamma, 
\Gamma''\seq {\bf valid}}$$
$$\infer{\Gamma, x:K', \Gamma'\seq A<_c B}{\Gamma, x:K, \Gamma'\seq A<_c B
\!\quad\!\Gamma \seq K=K'}$$
	
	\end{calculus}

Main requirement to the set $C$ (expressed in terms of $T[C]_0$) is {\em coherence}:
\begin{itemize}
\item If $\Gamma\seq A<_cB:Type$ then $\Gamma\seq A:Type$, $\Gamma\seq B:Type$ and $\Gamma\seq c: (El(A))El(B)$.
\item $\Gamma\not\seq A<_cA:Type$ for any $\Gamma, A, c$.
\item If $\Gamma\seq A<_c B:Type$ and $\Gamma\seq A<_{c'}B:Type$ then $\Gamma\seq c=c':(El(A))El(B)$.
\end{itemize}

	\begin{history}
Coercive subtiping as an abbreviation mechanism
was introduced in a conference paper~\cite{Luo96:CSL}.  
It was described for type theories specified in Z. Luo's typed $\LuoLF$
(extensions of $\LuoLF$)~\irefmissing{Typed LF for Type Theories}, but
the idea itself is much more general and may apply
to other type theories. The approach was further
developed in~\cite{jls:TYPES96, Luo:99, SolLuo:02, LuoSolXue:13}.

	% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
	% especially if they relate to other proof systems.
	% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system
	% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID).
	% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to
	% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
	 \end{history}
	
	\begin{technicalities}
	Main result
(that justifies the view of coercive
subtyping as an abbreviation mechanism)
is the conservativity theorem (conservativity of $T[C]$ w.r.t. the
type theory $T$), see~\cite{Luo:99, SolLuo:02, LuoSolXue:14}.
