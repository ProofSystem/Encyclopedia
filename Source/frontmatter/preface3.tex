The third edition of the Encyclopedia of
Proof Systems has only 2 new entries compared to the second edition, but it has a key technical improvement in its LaTeX code.

Editing a large document in LaTeX composed of many smaller and independently authored chapters can become complicated, because the LaTeX system has limits on the number of packages and alphabets that can be used simultaneously within certain environments. In the case of the Encyclopedia of Proof Systems, soon after the second edition, we reached some limits that prevented us from adding more entries. Fortunately, we are pleased to announce that we have managed to resolve this issue. The Encyclopedia of Proof Systems is ready to grow again and is once again open to more submissions.
