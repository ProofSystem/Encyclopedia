% The following sections ("clarifications", "history", 
% "technicalities") are optional. If you use them, 
% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences. 
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks 
% do not look nice in a short entry.

 \begin{clarifications}
% ToDo: write here short remarks that may help the reader to understand 
% the inference rules of the proof system.
The clausal temporal resolution calculus is for formulae of discrete propositional
linear-time temporal logic with finite past and infinite future.
Any LTL formula is first translated, in a satisfiability preserving way, into the
following  normal form: 
$\lstart \rightarrow A$, {\em an initial clause},
$ \Always (C \rightarrow  \Next A)$, {\em a step clause}, and
$\Always  (C   \rightarrow  \sometime l)$, {\em a sometime clause}.
%
This removes many of the operators, may add new propositional 
symbols, for example to rename subformulae.
%
The operator $\lstart$ only holds in the first moment in time. 
%
The resolvent of the temporal resolution rule needs further translation into
the normal form. 
%
In the rules $\ltrue$ stands for an empty conjunction of literals; $\lfalse$
stands for an empty disjunction of literals.
 \end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
% especially if they relate to other proof systems. 
% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system 
% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID). 
% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to 
% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
First proposed in~\cite{Fis90-resolve} earlier versions of 
the normal form and the calculus used clauses with past-time formulae
on the left-hand sides and present or future formulae on the
right-hand side. The above version of the resolution rules are
from~\cite{FDP01} and the calculus has been implemented in the prover
TRP++~\cite{HustadtKonev2003a}. 
A different presentation is provided in~\cite{DFK02}
using a {\em Divided Separated Normal Form}.
The calculus has been extended to the monodic fragment of First-Order 
temporal logic in~\iref{FOTLResolution}.
%, implemented in the prover TeMP~\cite{DBLP:conf/cade/HustadtKRV04}.
% splitting the formule into
%four sets: the initial and universal parts (both sets of propositional
%formula), the step part (similar to the above) and the eventuality
% part (unconditional sometime formula).
\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
% ToDo: write here remarks about soundness, completeness,
% decidability...
Soundness, completeness and termination are shown in~~\cite{FDP01}.

% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.


% Remove all instruction comments before submitting.


% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
