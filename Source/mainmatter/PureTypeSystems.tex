% The following sections ("clarifications", "history",
% "technicalities") are optional. If you use them,
% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences.
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks
% do not look nice in a short entry.

\begin{clarifications}
% ToDo: write here short remarks that may help the reader to understand
% the inference rules of the proof system.
\emph{Pure type systems} (PTS) are a general class of typed $\lambda$ calculus. They represent logical systems through the Curry-Howard correspondence and the "propositions as types" interpretation. The syntax is given by the grammar:
\negvspace\[
  \terms \Coloneqq \variables \mid \constants \mid \Pi \variables : \terms. \terms \mid \lambda \variables : \terms. \terms \mid \terms~\terms
\negvspace\]
where $\variables$ is a set of variables and $\constants$ is a set of constants.
A PTS is parameterized by a \emph{specification} $(\sorts, \axioms, \rules)$ where
$\sorts \subseteq \constants$ is the set of \emph{sorts},
$\axioms \subseteq \constants \times \sorts$ is the set of \emph{axioms}, and
$\rules \subseteq \sorts \times \sorts \times \sorts$ is the set of \emph{rules}.
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
% especially if they relate to other proof systems.
% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system
% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID).
% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to
% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
Pure type systems were independently introduced by Berardi and Terlouw as a generalization of systems of the $\lambda$ cube, and further developed and popularized by Barendregt, Geuvers, Nederhof \cite{barendregt_introduction_1991,geuvers_modular_1991,barendregt_lambda_1992,geuvers_logics_1993}. Many important systems can be expressed as PTSs, including simply typed $\lambda$ calculus ($\lambda{\rightarrow}$), $\lambda\Pi$ calculus \iref{LuoLF} ($\lambda{P}$), system F \iref{fc} ($\lambda{2}$), and the calculus of constructions ($\lambda{C}$):
\negvspace\[
  \begin{array}{cc}
    \sorts = \{\Prop, \Type\} \qquad \axioms = \{(\Prop, \Type)\} \qquad \rules_{\rightarrow} = \{(\Prop, \Prop, \Prop)\} \\[1ex]
    \rules_{P} = \rules_{\rightarrow} \union \{(\Prop,\Type,\Type)\} \qquad
    \rules_{2} = \rules_{\rightarrow} \union \{(\Type,\Prop,\Prop)\} \qquad
    \rules_{C} = \rules_{P} \union \rules_{2} \union \{(\Type,\Type,\Type)\}
  \end{array}
\negvspace\]
as well as intuitionistic higher-order logic ($\lambda{HOL}$). Pure type systems form the basis of many proof assistants such as Automath, Lego, Coq, Agda, and Matita.
\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
% ToDo: write here remarks about soundness, completeness, decidability...
Soundness and decidability of type checking in PTSs are closely related to \emph{strong normalization} (SN), i.e.~the property that all well-typed terms terminate. Not all pure type systems are SN. Examples of PTSs that are \emph{not} SN (and are therefore inconsistent) are Girard's system U and the universal PTS $\lambda{\Prop}$:
\negvspace\[
  \sorts = \{\Prop\} \qquad \axioms = \{(\Prop, \Prop)\} \qquad \rules = \{(\Prop, \Prop, \Prop)\}
\negvspace\]
\end{technicalities}


% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page.
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry,
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
%
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page,
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing"
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry,
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself.
% This is done automatically.
