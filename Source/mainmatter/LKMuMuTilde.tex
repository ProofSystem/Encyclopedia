% The following sections ("clarifications", "history",
% "technicalities") are optional. If you use them,
% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences.
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks
% do not look nice in a short entry.
\begin{clarifications}
There are three kinds of sequents: first $\Gamma \vdash v:A ~|~
\Delta$ with a distinguished formula on the right for typing the
program $v$, second $\Gamma ~|~ e:A \vdash \Delta$ with a
distinguished formula on the left for typing the evaluation context
$e$, and finally $c : (\Gamma \vdash \Delta)$ with no distinguished
formula for typing command $c$, i.e. the interaction of a program
within an evaluation context. The typing contexts $\Gamma$ and
$\Delta$ are lists of named formulas so that a non-ambiguous
correspondence with $\lambda$-calculus is possible (if it were sets or
multisets, there were e.g. no way to distinguish the two distinct
proofs of $x:A, x:A \vdash x:A ~|~$). Weakening rules are implemented
implicitly at the level of axioms. Contraction rules are derived,
using a cut against an axiom. No exchange rule is needed.  Not all
cuts are eliminable: only those not involving an axiom rule are.
Negation $\neg A$ can be defined as $A \rightarrow \bot$. In the rules
$\exists_E$ and $\forall_R$, $y$ is assumed fresh in $\Gamma$,
$\Delta$ and $A[x]$. The syntax of the underlying $\lambda$-calculus
is:
$$
\begin{array}{lll}
c & ::= & \cut{v}{e}\\
e & ::= & \alpha ~|~ \tilde\mu a.c ~|~ \pi_i\cdot e ~|~ [e,e] ~|~ v \cdot e ~|~ (t,e) ~|~ \tilde\lambda x.e ~|~ []\\
v & ::= & a ~|~ \mu\alpha.c ~|~ (v,v) ~|~ \iota_i(v) ~|~ \lambda a.v ~|~ \lambda x.v ~|~ (t,v) ~|~ ()\\
\end{array}
$$
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
The purpose of this system is to provide with a
$\lambda$-calculus-style computational meaning to Gentzen's LK
\iref{GentzenLK} and to highlight how the symmetries of sequent
calculus show computationally. Seeing the rules as typing rules, the
left/right symmetry is a symmetry between programs and their
evaluation contexts. At the level of cut elimination, giving priority
to the left-hand side relates to call-by-name evaluation while giving
priority to the right-hand side relates to call-by-value
evaluation~\cite{CurienHerbelin00}. Thanks to the presence of two dual
axiom rules and implicit contraction rules, the system supports a
tree-like sequent-free presentation like originally presented by
Gentzen for natural deduction~\cite{HerbelinHdR} (see
\iref{LKMuMuTildeTree}). The system can be seen as a symmetric variant
of $\lambdabar$-calculus~\iref{LambdaBar}.

The structural subsystem can be adapted to various sequent
calculi. Restriction to intuitionistic logic can be obtained by
demanding that the right-hand side has exactly one formula.

The presentation of this calculus with conjunctive and disjunctive
additive connectives has been studied in
\cite{Wadler03,HerbelinHdR}. A variant with only commands,
called ${\cal X}$, has been studied in \cite{BakLenLes05}, based on
previous work in~\cite{UrbanPhD}.  Various extensions of the system
emphasizing different symmetries can be found in the literature.

% \end{history}
\begin{technicalities}
The system is obviously logically equivalent to Gentzen's $\LK$ when
equipped with the corresponding connectives and observed through the
sequents of the form $\Gamma \vdash \Delta$.

% General Instructions:
% =====================
% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page.
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
% * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
% (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
% * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry,
% consider splitting your entry.
%
% * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
% that are already described in other entries.
%
% * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
%
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page,
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetical reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.
% Citation Instructions:
% ======================
% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.
% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.
% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing"
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry,
% as explained within the "history" environment above.
% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself.
% This is done automatically.
