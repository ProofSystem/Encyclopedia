% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks

\begin{clarifications}
  The syntax of LEI is given by the following BNF rule
  \begin{center} 
    \begin{math}
      %\begin{array}{lll}
        \phi ::= p \in Prop \mid \bot \mid \phi \land \phi \mid \phi \lor \phi \mid \phi \rightarrow \phi \mid \neg \phi \mid \sim \phi \mid \exists x\phi \mid \forall x\phi.
      %\end{array}
    \end{math}
  \end{center}
  
  LEI is intended to deal with the concept of plausibility. The $?$ and $!$ post-fixed operators symbolizes credulous and skeptical plausibility. The skeptical plausibility is defined as the dual of $?$, that is $\alpha ! := \sim ((\sim \alpha)?)$ LEI is a paraconsistent logic. It has two negation symbols $\sim$ (the classical negation) and $\neg$ (the paraconsistent negation). The $\sim$ can be defined as $\sim \alpha := \alpha \to \bot$. The intuitionistic absurd rule $\neg E$ is restricted to $?$-free formulas, which are represented by Roman capital letters. Introduction and elimination rules for $\land$, $\lor$, $\to$, $\forall$ and $\exists$ are the usual ones. The $?E$ rule has a quite involved restriction for its application. We need the following definitions.
  
  %\begin{definition} [Connection]
By a connection in a deduction $\Pi$ between two formula occurrences $\alpha$ 
and
$\beta$, we understand a sequence $\alpha_{1},\ldots,\alpha_{n}$ of formula 
occurrences
in $\Pi$ such that $\alpha_{1}=\alpha, \alpha_{n}=\beta$, and one of the 
following
conditions holds for each $i \leq n$:


\begin{enumerate}

\item
 $\alpha_{i}$ is not the major premise of an application of $\vee E$, 
$\exists E$ and
$?E$, and $\alpha_{i+1}$ stands immediately below $\alpha_{i}$; or vice 
versa;

\item 
$\alpha_{i}$ is a premise of an application of $\rightarrow E$, $\neg E$ or $\sim E$, and $\alpha_{i+1}$ is side connected with  $\alpha_{i}$;

\item 
$\alpha_{i}$ is  the major premise of an application of $\vee E$, $\exists E$ and
$?E$, and $\alpha_{i+1}$ is a hypothesis discharged by this application;  or 
vice versa;

\item 
$\alpha_{i}$ is a consequence of an application of $\rightarrow I$, 
$\neg I$, $\sim I$,
$\bot\neg$, $\bot\!\!\sim$, and $\alpha_{i+1}$ is a hypothesis discharged by 
this application;
 or vice versa;
\end{enumerate}
%\end{definition}

Two formula occurrences $\alpha$
and $\beta$  are said to be modally independent in a deduction $\Pi$ iff every
connection in $\Pi$ between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ contains an occurrence of a 
?-closed formula.

The $?E$ can only be applied when each occurrence of $\alpha$ is modally independent in $\Pi$ from $\beta$ and any (open) assumption of $\Pi$.

\end{clarifications}


% \begin{history}
% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
% especially if they relate to other proof systems. 
% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system 
% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID). 
% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to 
% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
% \end{history}

\begin{history}
The Logic of Epistemic Inconsistency was proposed by Pequeno and Buchsbaum \cite{pequeno1991}. The natural deduction system for LEI was created by Martins and Pequeno \cite{martins1993}.
\end{history}


% \begin{technicalities}
% ToDo: write here remarks about soundness, completeness, decidability...
% \end{technicalities}


\begin{technicalities}
Completeness and correctness for LEI has been proved in \cite{martins1997}. Normalization for the system above has been proved in \cite{martins2007}.
\end{technicalities}

% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.


% Remove all instruction comments before submitting.


% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
