Where $x$ does not occur in $v$ and $\sigma = [v/x]$.
\end{calculus}

\begin{clarifications}
  $x$ is a variable. $v_1,\ldots,v_n, u_1,\ldots, u_n$ are terms.  $\upair v u$
  and $\spair v u$ are unsolved and solved, respectively, pairs of first-order
  terms. $S$ is a set of such pairs and $\sigma$ is a substitution.
  The set $S$ is considered solved if it contains only solved pairs. 
\end{clarifications}

\begin{history}
   The unification principle was first described by Herbrand in his
   thesis~\cite{herbrand1930recherches} but was overlooked until rediscovered
   independently by Prawitz~\cite{Prawitz1960} and
   Guard~\cite{guard1964automated} (where it is called matching, not to be
   confused with the modern notion of matching - the unification of a term with
   a ground term).  These findings helped pave the way for Robinson's seminal
   work on Resolution~\cite{Robinson1965JACM} (see~\iref{Resolution}).  The
   above set of rules is taken from Snyder and Gallier~\cite{Snyder1989101}.
\end{history}

\begin{technicalities}
   The application of the above rules always terminates on a given set of pairs
   of terms and if, in addition, the set is unifiable, then it terminates in a
   set $S'$ containing only solved pairs.  The set $S'$ contains the
   substitution components~\cite{Robinson1965JACM} of a most general unifier of
   $S$.  The choice of which rule to apply is a ``don't-care'' non-determinism,
   which means that the resulting substitutions, if they exist, are identical up
   to renaming of free variables.
