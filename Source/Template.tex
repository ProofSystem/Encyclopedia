% If your files are called "MyProofSystem.tex" and "MyProofSystem.bib", 
% then you should write "\begin{entry}{MyProofSystem}" in the line below
\begin{entry}{ToDo}  

% Define here any newcommands you may need:
% e.g. \newcommand{\necessarily}{\Box}
% e.g. \newcommand{\possibly}{\Diamond}


\begin{calculus}

% Add the inference rules of your proof system here.
% The "proof.sty" and "bussproofs.sty" packages are available.
% If you need any other package, please contact the coordinator (Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo <bruno.wp@gmail.com>)

\end{calculus}

% The following sections ("clarifications", "history", 
% "technicalities") are optional. If you use them, 
% be very concise and objective. Nevertheless, do write full sentences. 
% Try to have at most one paragraph per section, because line breaks 
% do not look nice in a short entry.

% \begin{clarifications}
% ToDo: write here short remarks that may help the reader to understand 
% the inference rules of the proof system.
% \end{clarifications}

% \begin{history}
% ToDo: write here short historical remarks about this proof system,
% especially if they relate to other proof systems. 
% Use "\iref{OtherProofSystem}" to refer to another proof system 
% in the Encyclopedia (where "OtherProofSystem" is its ID). 
% Use "\irefmissing{SuggestedIDForOtherProofSystem}" to refer to 
% another proof system that is not yet available in the encyclopedia.
% \end{history}

% \begin{technicalities}
% ToDo: write here remarks about soundness, completeness, decidability...
% \end{technicalities}


% General Instructions:
% =====================

% The preferred length of an entry is 1 page. 
% Do the best you can to fit your proof system in one page.
%
% If you are finding it hard to fit what you want in one page, remember:
%
%   * Your entry needs to be neither self-contained nor fully understandable
%     (the interested reader may consult the cited full paper for details)
%
%   * If you are describing several proof systems in one entry, 
%     consider splitting your entry.
%
%   * You may reduce the size of your entry by ommitting inference rules
%     that are already described in other entries.
%
%   * Cite parsimoniously (see detailed citation instructions below).
%
% 
% If you do not manage to fit everything in one page, 
% it is acceptable for an entry to have 2 pages.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, it is preferable for an entry to have
% 1 full page or 2 full pages, in order to avoid unused blank space.



% Citation Instructions:
% ======================

% Please cite the original paper where the proof system was defined.
% To do so, you may use the \cite command within 
% one of the optional environments above,
% or use the \nocite command otherwise.

% You may also cite a modern paper or book where the 
% proof system is explained in greater depth or clarity.
% Cite parsimoniously.

% Do not cite related work. Instead, use the "\iref" or "\irefmissing" 
% commands to make an internal reference to another entry, 
% as explained within the "history" environment above.

% You do not need to create the "References" section yourself. 
% This is done automatically.


% Remove all instruction comments before submitting.


% Leave an empty line above "\end{entry}".
